# HSBMAS - Hierarchical Switching-Backbone Multi-agent System

## Introduction
HSBMAS is a fully decentralized framework of the multi-agent system for consensus seeking. The framework can control the convergence evolution with hierarchical features of the network topology by only referring to local one-hop and two-hop neighbors' state. Notably, the proposed framework runs in a distributed and synchronous fashion. The outline and diagram of our framework are shown in the following figures.

## Dataset 
This project contains the dataset of 10 types of topological structures in the square 20r_c × 20r_c and, each of which has five different densities described as ρ=N/L^2 and is connected initially. The density ρ represents that N agents distributed in a square-shape area of linear size L [<sup>1</sup>](#refer-topology)
ρ≈2,4,6,8,10.
