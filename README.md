# HSBMAS - Hierarchical Switching-Backbone Multi-agent System
HSBMAS is a fully decentralized framework of the multi-agent system for consensus seeking. The framework can control the convergence evolution with hierarchical features of the network topology by only referring to local one-hop and two-hop neighbors' state. Notably, the proposed framework runs in a distributed and synchronous fashion. The outline and diagram of our framework are shown in the following figures.

this project contains the dataset of 10 types of topological structures in the square $ 20r_c\times20r_c $ and, each of which has five densities.
