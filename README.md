# HSBMAS - Hierarchical Switching-Backbone Multi-agent System
HSBMAS is a fully decentralized framework of the multi-agent system for consensus seeking. The framework can control the convergence evolution with hierarchical features of the network topology by only referring to local one-hop and two-hop neighbors' state. Notably, the proposed framework runs in a distributed and synchronous fashion. The outline and diagram of our framework are shown in the following figures.
